# Frontend Portfolio

Welcome to my Frontend Portfolio! This repository is a collection of various frontend projects I have worked on. Each project is designed to illustrate a specific aspect of web development, from basic HTML structures to more complex JavaScript interactions. The main `index.html` file provides an organized list of all the projects, allowing easy navigation and access.
